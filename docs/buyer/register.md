## Create your Sevi App PIN
After successfully verifying your phone number, the next step is to create a four-digit PIN for your Sevi App. 

:::tip
This PIN will be used to log in to your Sevi App. Kindly memorize it or write it down on a piece of paper or save it on your mobile device.
:::note 
This is the same PIN you will use to log in to your account using our USSD service.
:::caution
Never share your PIN with others, this will give them access to your Sevi account. Sevi and our support team will never ask for your PIN.

## Take a picture of your ID card

Please take a photo of your ID card, both front and back.

> **NOTE:** Take a picture of the ID in a well-lit environment.  Ensure all four corners of the document are visible, and there are no reflections (if your phone’s flashlight is on, be sure to switch it off). Clean the lens, hold the phone steady, and align the camera for your ID to fit the frame. Proceed to take the picture and ensure that the information on it is legible. If you’re not sure of the quality, you can retake the photo.

## Take a Selfie Picture.
Please take a profile picture of yourself. Your photo will be used as your profile photo in the Sevi app, as well as for KYC purposes and to protect your account against ID fraud by others. 

Uploading of your photo might take a few minutes depending on your internet connection, please don't close the app.
